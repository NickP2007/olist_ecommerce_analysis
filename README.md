# olist_ecommerce_analysis
This is a personal data analysis project that is still in development and is not yet fully complete. While a large portion of the analysis I set out to complete, the files still need to be properly organized, some code still requires adequate explanation, and my presentation of the analysis (in progress) must be uploaded. This is a project I have worked on in my own spare time to showcase my Python and SQL development. Any helpful feedback recognizing that this is the first major project I have uploaded to GitHub is welcome and appreciated! The dataset is composed of 9 csv files downloaded from Kaggle, representing anonymized data from Brazil's Olist retail platform.
